# React, React-Bootstrap, and ES-6 on Rails via WebPack

# Motivation

1. Enable development of a JS client separate from Rails.
2. Enable easily retrofitting such a JS framework into an existing Rails app.
3. Enable the use of the JavaScript es6 transpiler.
4. Enable easily using npm modules with a Rails application.

# Example of the following technologies:

1. react
2. react-bootstrap
3. webpack with hot-reload
4. es6-loader (es6 transpiler)
5. Simultaneously working with Rails 4.2
6. Deployable to Heroku

# Running without Rails using Hot Reload

Setup node and run the node server.
```
npm install
cd webpack && node server.js
```

Point browser to [http://0.0.0.0:3000]().

Save a change to a JSX file and see it update immediately in the browser! Note,
any browser state still exists, such as what you've typed in the comments box.
That's totally different than "Live Reload" which refreshes the browser.

# Rails

```
bundle install
rake db:setup
rails s -p 4000
```
Point browser to [http://0.0.0.0:4000]().

It's important to run the rails server on different port than the node server.

## Automatically Building the rails-bundle.js
Run this command to automatically build the rails-bundle.js file in the
javascript directory whenever your jsx files change.

```
cd webpack
webpack -w --config webpack.rails.config.js
```

# Webpack Configuration
`webpack.hot.config.js`: Used by server.js to run the demo server.
`webpack.rails.config.js`: Used to generate the rails-bundle.js file

# Notes on Rails Assets
## Javascript
The `webpack.rails.config.js` file generates rails-bundle.js which is included
by the Rails asset pipeline.

## Sass and images
1. The Webpack server loads the images from the **symlink** of of the
   app/assets/images directory.
2. Since the images are not moved, Rails loads images via the normal asset
   pipeline features.
3. The `image-url` sass helper takes care of mapping the correct directories for
   images. The image directory for the webpack server is configured by this
   line:

    { test: /\.scss$/, loader: "style!css!sass?outputStyle=expanded&imagePath=/assets/images"}

# Source Maps
They work for both Rails and the Webpack Server!

# Deploying to Heroku

In order to deploy to heroku, you'll need run this command once to set a custom
buildpack:

```
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
```

This runs the two buildpacks in the `.buildpacks` directory.

# TO DO
1. (Optionally) integrate twitter bootstrap assets into webpack build with way
   to configure same options for Rails and Webpack.
